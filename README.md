# Workstation

This is a workshop to create a planet. You'll be like a god and you can choose from 5 different things on board to add to your planet: bird, fish, flower, tree and human. By clicking the button with words and then clicking the blue planet, you can add the element anywhere you like. Do whatever you want to your planet, but be careful, something may be out of your control.

# SPOILER ALERT
Try adding human 10 times. The outcome can be elaborated in two ways and either one is ok:
Human activities will severely affect environment.
Humans getting together can overthrow the government of god.
